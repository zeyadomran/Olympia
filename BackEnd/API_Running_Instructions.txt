This text file will describe all the steps you need to run the API.

1. MySQL Server
	In order for the API to work, it needs to connect to an MySQL server.
	You can install MySQL from here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
	You need MySQL(Server,Shell,Router) and I would reccomend Connector/Python

	I would also recomment installing MySQL workbench from the same link.
	

2. Import the Server State from Github and Run Server on LocalHost
	TBD

3. Python
	You need a handful of packages in order to run the API
	(Flask,flask-cors,app,flask-mysql,PyMySQL)
		Please see "API python imports.txt" for pip commands
	
	Once you have the dependencies, write your MySQL server info inside config.py

4. Run main.py
	The printout should display what is being served as well as
	where your API is running.
